        It’s contentious, I know. Some people consider themselves a dog mom or dad, a dog guardian, a pet parent, a dog’s partner, or any 
        other number of phrases that try to take away from the sense of a dog being property. But, for the sake of discussion, I’m using dog
         owner because, well, legally that’s what we are.   
  </p> <br>
  <p>
    According to Law Insider, <b style="color: rgb(241, 3, 122);"> “Dog Owner</b> means any person 18 years of age or older who owns, controls, keeps, harbors, has custody of a dog or
     any person who allows a dog to remain on or about his/her premises; or the parent or guardian of any child under the age of 18 years, who 
     owns, keeps, controls, harbors, has custody of a dog or any person who allows a dog to remain on or about his/her premises.” 
    </p>

    <p>
        Since all of those pieces of the definition impact whether or not someone is responsible, we’re going with dog owner for this post. 
        Let’s be real: Being an irresponsible dog owner can land you in a pit of legal trouble.

    So, what makes you a responsible dog owner?

            “Owning a dog is not just a privilege-it's a responsibility.” Whether you own a dog or a cat one thing is for sure, owning that
             pet comes with great responsibility.

            Pets are not accessories that can be thrown aside and forgotten. Pets are companions that need love, care and devotion. You can 
            find many lists that outline very specific ways to be a responsible pet owner, like the American Kennel Club’s list for dog owners,
             but we’ve compiled a short list for you of the important rules we think all pet owners must live by.
        </p><br>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b style="color: rgb(241, 3, 122);">Make him part of the family.</b> Pets, especially dogs, need companionship. They are traditionally pack creatures and need the 
                warmth and love that comes with living indoors with their family.
            </li>
        </ul>

                <b style="color: rgb(241, 3, 122);">Pet proof your house.</b> To keep your pet healthy you should research what household 
                products and foods can harm your pet. Make sure these are kept in secure locations so your pet cannot get into them.

                     Insuring your pet may also be important to your pet’s health. Emergencies can happen at any time. Ensure your pet gets 
                     the help he needs no matter the cost with pet insurance.
